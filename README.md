# mlops-journey
My learning journey through MLOps Zoomcamp from DataTalksClub, I welcome everyone to check this repo. This repository focuses on the implementation of MLOps for machine learning workflows. It will covers these different keys below:

1. Creating a reproducible development environment.
2. Automate the data preprocessing and data training pipelines.
3. ML model deployment with CI/CD workflows and Ops metrics evaluation.
4. Monitoring model performance in production and/or compare 2 or more models.
5. Documenting the entire process for scability and collaboration.
